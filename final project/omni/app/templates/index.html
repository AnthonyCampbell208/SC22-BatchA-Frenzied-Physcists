                        <p class="lead">Strokes are responsible for 1 in 20 deaths in the United States of America and are ranked number five in the country's leading causes of death. In fact, the Center for Disease Control reports that the frequency of stroke deaths is so high than on average a persons loses their life to a stroke every 3.5 minutes. One in four stroke victims had strokes before. By being able to observe trends in stroke victims, such as the correlation between smoking and risk of stroke, our A.I. may be able to help people better plan for prevention.</p>

                   <h2>Why Machine Learning? </h2>
                        <p class="lead">As developing coders, we wanted to know if it was possible to classify strokes using machine learning. But why machine learning? The importance of machine learning in health is that our model can serve as a tool for health care professionals who are fallible to human error. Even the most skilled doctors may misdiagnose, so an unbiased model can assist in catching mistakes and potentially save lives. </p>

                        <h2>A retrospective view of a completed model and developmental challenges.</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Before writing our first line of code, our team determined which roadblocks we'd most have to concern ourselves with. First and foremost, we acknowledged that most of us had never coded before, let alone build a machine learning model. Then, we knew that we would have to clean our data. The data set that we had imported from Kaggle had many NaN values and an entire column with patient IDs that was irrelevant to our model. Our trouble did not end there however. Very early on we realized that our data was at risk of containing outliers that would throw off our model and tug averages in a given direction. While our concerns with our data never became an issue, we were able to begin coding by dividing up the work, and the rows with NaN values and the ID column were removed, we found that our most inhibiting difficulty did lie in our data set, just not where we had expected it to. After running stratified data through five different types of classifiers, it was discovered that our data contained a debilitating uneven ratio of stroke victims to non-stroke victims, heavily favoring those who had reported not experiencing a stroke. Because of this ratio, many of our outputs showed zeros in results. To address the issue, we downsized the number of non-stroke victims and synthesized new data for stroke victims, evening out our ratio. With our modified data set, we re-ran our classifiers and obtained more workable results. Ultimately, our final product was based off of our heavily modified data set, which may account for errors in prediction.  </p>
