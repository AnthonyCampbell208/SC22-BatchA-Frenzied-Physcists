                        <p class="lead">For our data science project, we created a model that would analyze and predict the probability of having a stroke based on a data set. We discovered our stroke data on the Kaggle website. The goal we originally had was to use the machine learning and to make a website where people could answer the list of questions and to see if one was at risk for a stroke. Now, our product uses machine learning to classify individuals with certain traits into categories that indicate stroke risk. Our tech stack included: </p>

                        <p class="lead">Strokes are responsible for 1 in 20 deaths in the United States of America and are ranked number five in the country's leading causes of death. In fact, the Center for Disease Control reports that the frequency of stroke deaths is so high than on average a persons loses their life to a stroke every 3.5 minutes. One in four stroke victims has had a stroke before. By being able to observe trends in stroke victims, such as the correlation between smoking and risk of stroke, our A.I. may be able to help people better prevent this often fatal occurence.</p>

                   <h2>Why Machine Learning? </h2>
                        <p class="lead">As developing coders, we wanted to know if it was possible to classify strokes using machine learning. But why machine learning? The importance of machine learning in health is that our model can serve as a tool for health care professionals who are fallible to human error. Even the most skilled doctors may misdiagnose, so an unbiased model can assist in catching mistakes and potentially save lives. </p>

                        <p class="lead">For our project, the Frenzied Physicists made various graphs in order to make conclusions based on the different traits in our data (age, sex, bmi, smoking habits, etc.) and how they might relate to having strokes.</p>
                       <h3>Histograms</h3>
                      <p class= "lead"><b>Stroke Histogram</b></p>
                   <iframe width="900" height="900" title="Correlation Table of Features" 
	src="../static/plots/strokes_histogram.html"></iframe>
                      <p class="lead">Our first plot was a histogram displaying the correlation between age and stroke status. The y-axis represents the number of individuals in each category, while the x-axis gives us two categories for the people in our data set to fall into: 0, which means that a person has not experienced a stroke, and 1, meaning the person has suffered a stroke. From plotting our data set onto a histogram this way it becomes easy to see that 587 people have never had a stroke, while 470 individuals have suffered a stroke. </p>
                  </div>
                      <p class= "lead"> <b>Strokes in relation to average glucose level</b></p>
                  <iframe width="900" height="900" title="Strokes Histogram" 
	src="../static/plots/Strokes_histogram_Glucose.html"></iframe> 
                      <p class="lead">This plot is one of our simpler histograms but exemplifies how useful visual histograms are in quickly determining the significance of an observation. Here, our y-axis tells us how many people belong in each category, and the x-axis tells us which categories we're even looking at. The X-axis tells us how many stroke victims and non-stroke victims belong to each average glucose level. Stroke victims are shown in red while non-stroke victims are shown in blue. With all of that said, we can see a massive difference in the average glucose levels of stroke victims in comparison to non-stroke victims, with stroke victims typically having much higher average glucose levels than non-stroke victims. It is also worth noting that most participants in the data set have average glucose levels around the 90-99.99 range, with small spike later in the average glucose level range around 190-199.99.</p>
                 <p class="lead">
                   <b> Age in relation to strokes</b></p>
                  <iframe width="900" height="900" title="Strokes Histogram" 
	src="../static/plots/age_histogram.html"></iframe>
                  <p class ="lead">This histogram and the one proceeding it follow the same color scheme and y-axis, with the only differences being the x-axis being swapped out for a different feature. In this histogram instead of looking at the average glucose level we are looking at age! This is probably the most apparent distinction that can be made, as the number of stroke victims can be seen shooting up dramatically from the age range of 75-79.99. It may also be noted that non-stroke victims can be around any age.</p>
 <p class= "lead"> <b>BMI Histogram</b></p>
                    <iframe width="900" height="900" title="BMI Histogram" 
	src="../static/plots/bmi_histogram.html"></iframe> 
                  <p class= "lead">Once more we will be looking at body mass index. The y-axis is still "count", however this time our x-axis is "b.m.i." This plot tells us that the average b.m.i. for stroke victims follows the same curve as non-stroke victims, sitting at an average between 27 and 27.99. The only difference we could find with this one is that there are just more people with that b.m.i. in our stroke victim category. </p>
                      </div>
                      <h3>Scatter Plots</h3>
          <p class= "lead"><b>Glucose vs. Age</b></p>

	src="../static/plots/glucose_vs_age_scatter.html"></iframe>
              <p class= "lead">This scatter plot helps us understand one health condition of the participants in the survey our data set is based off of. While this scatter plot does not explicitly helps us learn about causes of stroke, it, like the two plots proceeding, do helps us identify trends in the differences between common traits of stroke victims and non-stroke victims. On our y=axis is the age range all of the patients fell in between, and on the x-axis is the average glucose level of those patients. The visualization helps us notice a higher concentration of individuals with high average glucose level in older age groups.</p>
           <p class= "lead"><b>Age vs. BMI</b></p>
                      <iframe width="900" height="900" title="Correlation Table of Features" 
	src="../static/plots/age_bmi_scatter.html"></iframe>
              <p class="lead">The correlation between age and body mass index is also an interesting peephole into the different traits of stroke victims and non-stroke victims, except this time instead of their being an observed trend, the visualization actually helps us see that the connection we were looking for is weak and not worth taking into account. Despite the line of best fit displaying an upward tilt, the amount of outliers in the data is too large for any hard distinction to be made. BMI rests along the y-axis while age sits on the x-axis. Take a look for yourself and see what we mean.</p>
               <p class= "lead"><b>Glucose vs. BMI</b></p>
                      <iframe width="900" height="900" title="Corr    elation Table of Features" 
	src="../static/plots/glucose_vs_bmi_scatter.html"></iframe>
  <p class="lead">In this scatter plot, blue represents stroke victims and red accounts for non-stroke victims, an inversion from the previous plots on this website. With that said, this scatter plot displays a positive trend upward, but the correlation is not significant enough to be notable. This scatter plot only confirms earlier findings. Individuals who have strokes tend to have higher average glucose levels. The scattered nature of b.m.i. here though suggest no significant link. </p>
   <p class= "lead"><b>Age vs. BMI + Glucose</b></p>
                       <iframe width="900" height="900" title="Correlation Table of Features" 
	src="../static/plots/Scatter_bmiVSage.html"></iframe>
              <p class="lead"> On this scatter plot, body mass index and average glucose level are fixed on the y-axis while age sits on the x-axis. It should be apparent that as the color shifts to yellow and the size of the dots get bigger, the average glucose level getting is increasing. From this visualization we can confirm our assessment from earlier that age and average glucose level have a positive relationship, and even re-evaluate our earlier thoughts on the relationship between age and body mass index,as there does appear to be an increase in b.m.i. with age as well. </p>

The graph also shows 'Outliers' which means that there are a few points out of place.

            <iframe width="900" height="900" title="Correlation Table of Features" 
	src="../static/plots/strokedf_correlation_matrix.html"></iframe> 
            
            <p class= "lead">A correlation matrix is highly complex and very interesting to study. All of our X variables, which in this case is over a dozen trait statuses are placed on BOTH the X and y axises. From there, a grid is formed  in which we can directly see the correlation between two traits. The higher the correlation between two traits, the more yellow the box is, meaning there is a perfect correlation between the two. You may notice that cutting through the middle of the grid is descending diagonal yellow line. This is where two identical values match up, creating a box where the two are obviously related. When there exists a 1, the line of best fit is flat and horizontal. There are no trends upwards or downwards. If a number is decimal such as .5, than there will be loosely plotted points that generally are rising up. Vice versa, -0.5 would be a series of loosely affiliated points descending. To conclude, a 0 value indicates no correlation and will be marked by random points from which no line can be drawn.</p>

The decision tree is taking the attributes and splitting the data into subsets, predicting a logical outcome based on what it is given. Each of the boxes show important data like, for instance, at the to it says "age is less than or equal to 53.015" if this is true than the patient will move to the left, and if it is false it will go to the right, it will then follow this pattern of "x is less than or equal to y" until we reach the bottom. (Leaves are the decisions).  Also you can see that each of the boxes are colored orange or blue, if it is colored blue than that patient in out data had a stroke whereas if it is orange they did not have a stroke, also as the colors get lighter  the gini impurity gets higher, Gini impurity is a function that determines how well a decision tree was split, so the closer to zero it is the better it is when it is closer to 0.5, which is the maximum, that means the tree was split worse.</p>

<p class = "lead"><b>Logistic regression</b> is used to find the probability of something happening by  having the logistic odds of the event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables. We used logistic regression to predict and categorize our dependent variable (stroke) and by using a set of independent variables (age, health conditions) to determine a binary outcome such as yes or no. When running our model we got a high accuracy score, which meant that our models predictions were correct given a certain set of data.

SVC puts the data into a hyperplane which separates our 'stroke' and 'no stroke' data with a decision boundary line. For our parameters we applied the rbf kernel and gamma which helps with non linear classifier, while the C parameter trades off correct classification of training examples against maximization of the boundary line.  The results weren't amazing, other model learning machines were better, but they were pretty good results. Lacking in precision, the SVC came out with a lot of false positives and fewer false negatives which is better for our data set since we are dealing with strokes. In the real world, it is better to predict a false stroke then to predict no stroke at all.

   <p class="lead">The abbreviation <b>KNN</b> stands for “K-Nearest Neighbor”. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements. The number of nearest neighbors to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol 'K'. We are often notified that you share many characteristics with your nearest peers, whether it be your thinking process, working etiquettes, philosophies, or other factors. As a result, we build friendships with people we deem similar to us. The KNN algorithm employs the same principle. Its aim is to locate all of the closest neighbors around a new unknown data point in order to figure out what class it belongs to. It’s a distance-based approach. </p>

                        <p class="lead">Before writing our first line of code, our team determined which roadblocks we'd most have to concern ourselves with. First and foremost, we acknowledged that most of us had never coded before, let alone build a machine learning model. Then, we knew that we would have to clean our data. The data set that we had imported from Kaggle had many NaN values and an entire column with patient IDs that was irrelevant to our model. Our trouble did not end there however. Very early on we realized that our data was at risk of containing outliers that would throw off our model and tug averages in a given direction. While our concerns with our data never became an issue, we were able to begin coding by dividing up the work, and the rows with NaN values and the ID column were removed, we found that our most inhibiting difficulty did lie in our data set, just not where we had expected it to. After running stratified data through five different types of classifiers, it was discovered that our data contained a debilitating uneven ratio of stroke victims to non-stroke victims, heavily favoring those who had reported not experiencing a stroke. Because of this ratio, many of our outputs showed zeros in results. To address the issue, we downsized the number of non-stroke victims and synthesized new data for stroke victims, evening out our ratio. With our modified data set, we re-ran our classifiers and obtained more workable results. Ultimately, our final product was based off of our heavily modified data set, which may account for errors in prediction.  </p>
