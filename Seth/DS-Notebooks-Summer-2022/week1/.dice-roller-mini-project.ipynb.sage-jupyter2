{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"477bc4","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"72296f","input":"While the code still runs 5 times, the output has changed. It now includes 5!

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ad27b0","input":"Unlike with for loops, in while loops it is important where in the loop the code is. For example, in the loop below we will swap the print line and the \"i = i + 1\" line and see what that does to the output.","pos":32,"state":"done","type":"cell"}
